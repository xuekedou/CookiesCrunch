# CookiesCrunch
This is a popular game now.
I follow the tutorial to make one and add my own comments.

**customize the game by myself later on the following areas**
*Special cookies when the player matches a certain shape. For example, Candy Crush Saga gives you a cookie that can clear an entire row when you match a 4-in-a-row chain.
*Detection of special chains, such as L- or T-shapes, that reward the player with bonus points or special power-ups.
*Boosts, or power-ups the player can use any time they want. For example, one boost might remove all the cookies of one type from the screen at once.
*Jelly levels: On these levels, some tiles are covered in jelly. You have X moves to remove all the jelly. This is where the Tile class comes in handy. You can give it a Bool jelly property and if the player matches a cookie on this tile, set the jelly property to false to remove the jelly.
*Hints: If the player doesnâ€™t make a move for two seconds, light up a pair of cookies that make a valid swap.
*Shuffle the cookies automatically if there are no possible moves.
